    Prepare WSGI Invenio application based on Flask.

    Invenio consists of a new Flask application with legacy support for
    the old WSGI legacy application and the old Python legacy
    scripts (URLs to *.py files).

    An incoming request is processed in the following manner:

     * The Flask application first routes request via its URL routing
       system (see LegacyAppMiddleware.__call__()).

     * One route in the Flask system, will match Python legacy
       scripts (see static_handler_with_legacy_publisher()).

     * If the Flask application aborts the request with a 404 error, the request
       is passed on to the WSGI legacy application (see page_not_found()). E.g.
       either the Flask application did not find a route, or a view aborted the
       request with a 404 error.
